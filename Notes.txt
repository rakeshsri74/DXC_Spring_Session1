Introduction To Spring:
	-Spring is a framework which is lightweight.
	-Spring is popular non-standard open-source framework developed by Interface21 Inc.
	-It aims to overcome the application problems by enabling the use of Simple java beans(POJOs) to implement
	the business logic.
	-Enables the developers to create and test application easily.
	-Aims to minimize the dependency of application code on its framework.
		class Draw{
			public void paint(){
				System.out.println("Paint");
			}
		}
		class Triangle{
			public void triangleDrawn(Draw draw)
			{
				draw.paint();
			}
		}
		class Main{
			public static void main(String[] args){
				Draw d = new Draw();
				Triangle t = new Triangle();
				t.triangleDrawn(d);
			}
		}
	-Enable the use of simplicity and ease of testability in standalone applications.

Features of Spring:
	1.Pluggability
		-It allows you to associate and remove business layer objects with each other with the help of configuration files.
		-Spring requires you to make changes in the XML configuration file and run the application again to take effect.
	2.Dependency Injection
		-It allows loose coupling by creating the business layer objects based on the description in spring configuration file.
		-As a result, it eases the maintanance and the testing of an application.
		-Dependency Injection is a fundamental aspect of the Spring framework, through which the Spring container "injects" objects into other
		objects or "dependencies".Simply put, this allows for loose coupling of components andd moves the responsibility of managing
		components onto the container.
	3.Container
		-The Spring framework is a container that holds all the application objects.
		-It is responsible for managing the life cycle and configuration of all the application objects.
		-The container creates objects,which are defined in configuration files,and associate them together.
		-Spring IOC(Inversion Of Control's) is the mechanism to achieve loose-coupling between Object dependencies.To achieve loose coupling and
		dynamic binding of the objects at runtime,objects dependencies are injected by other assembler objects.
	4.AOP(Aspect Oriented Programming)
		-Aspect Oriented Programming which is defined as modularization of the system-wide concerns,such as transaction management and security.
	5.Lightweight
		-Spring is a lightweight framework that makes easy to configure and create complex applications.
		-It consists of several well-defined module,built upon the concept of DI and AOP.

The Spring framework provide two type of container:
	1.Bean Factory
		-Is a simple container that provides support for DI.
	2.Application Context
		-Is built upon the concept of the bean factory container and provides other functionalities also such as easy integration with Spring AOP 		and also support for internationalization.
